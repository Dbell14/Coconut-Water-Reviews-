## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

[Negative]

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

[I do not believe that the labels are 100% correct. For the most part it accurately described the user's review.  

It has some that were positive that shouldnt been negative. It seem if it had love or great in the review it was given a positive however the review may have been talking about another product or how ZICO use to taste. There were also some that were negative that shouldve been positive. For example one said that its wasnt its favorite however still gave good things about the drink. Another said he didnt like and dont buy the drink in a 14.2oz bottle but love the taste of the one in the 110z tetra box and recommended others to buy that one.

The risk model hallucinations introduce is wrong results based off misinterpretation of the data.  This may come from the lack of OpenAI or the thoroughness of the system prompt and prompt. ]

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

[To improve customer statisfaction I would recommend to stop making it from concentrate and using natural flavors.  It may be the reason the water has a bad smell and taste which includes the after taste. Their long time repeat customers love the pure coconut water they used to make the drink. Also I would go back to the tetra packs because customers dont like the plastic taste from the bottles they are currently using. If thats not a option then a better quality plastic bottle needs to be used. Find out why the drink taste different in the bigger size bottles. What about that bottle is changing the taste.

I believe its a huge opportunity for this business to improve its product. Their customers both new and repeat have spoken about their dissatisfaction of the product and how others are better. Majority of the customers have the same complaints and with new customers not wanting to buy again and the repeat loyal customers leaving. They are losing market share by the bottle. As a business you have to fix the things your customers are complaining about especially when its not a one off its the majority. ]
