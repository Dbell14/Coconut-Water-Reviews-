## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

[Negative]

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

[I do not believe that the labels are 100% correct. For the most part it accurately described the user's review.  
It has some that were positive that shouldnt been negative. It seem if it had love or great in the review it was given a positive however the review may have been talking about another product or how ZICO use to taste. There were also some that were negative that shouldve been positive. For example one said that its wasnt its favorite however still gave good things about the drink. Another said he didnt like and dont buy the drink in a 14.2oz bottle but love the taste of the one in the 110z tetra box and recommended others to buy that one.

The risk model hallucinations introduce is wrong results based off misinterpretation of the data and Open AI creating its own reviews and sentiments. I noctice this because its suppose to be 50 reviews and sentiments however 76 came out. This may come from the lack of OpenAI or the thoroughness of the system prompt and prompt. ]

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

[Based on the sentiment analysis, the most common sentiment among the customer reviews was negative. A large number of reviews expressed frustration with the product's smell, taste, and aftertaste which is often linked to the drink being made from concentrate and using “natural flavors.”

Long-time repeat customers specifically mentioned that they preferred the original version, which used pure coconut water, and noticed a significant decline in quality. Additionally, many reviews highlighted a strong plastic taste, believed to come from the newer bottles. Some mentioned that the larger-sized bottles tasted different (and worse) than the smaller ones.

Given the consistency of these complaints and the fact that both new and loyal customers are voicing them — and in some cases leaving for other brands — it shows there’s a significant opportunity to improve customer satisfaction and regain market share.

My recommendation would be go back to using pure coconut water and consider switching back to tetra packs, or at least upgrading the plastic bottle quality. Investigate the formula and packaging of the larger-sized bottles to identify what’s causing the change in taste.]
